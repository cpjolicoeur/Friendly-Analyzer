# Friendly Analyzer

This project is a single-page, vanilla HTML/JS app.

## Run locally (recommended)

Serving the files over HTTP avoids browser restrictions that can occur when opening files directly.

### Using Python

From the project directory:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

- http://localhost:8000/index.html

## Notes

- There is no build step.
- JavaScript is loaded from `js/` and CSS from `css/`.
